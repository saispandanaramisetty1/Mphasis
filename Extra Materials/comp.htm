A stack is implemented as a (singly-linked) linked-list, where each node 
contains data and address of another node. The top node will contain the address 
of which node?<BR>Op 1: No node. It will be empty<BR>Op 2: The node containing

a linear array of size 10 (and not as a circularly connected array). Front and 
Rear are represented as an index in the array. To add an element, the rear index 
is incremented and the element is added. To delete an element, the front index 
is incremented. The following operations are done on an empty queue.<BR>ADD 1; 
DELETE; ADD 2; ADD 3; ADD 4; DELETE, DELETE <BR>After this set of operations,
